This is the start of my Ruby on Rails blog for the url uxarchitect.me
Tonight is April the 10th 2013 and I am starting the project with the
initialization of a github repo and asset creation. Server is setup with the
latest copy of Rails 3.23 and nginx + postgreSQL + passenger + backbonejs and
supporting libraries. More to come, this is the initial commit.
